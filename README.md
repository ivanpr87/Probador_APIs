# API Sentinel

**Catch API validation issues before your users do.**

An AI-powered quality analyzer that automatically stress-tests HTTP endpoints using a local LLM, scores their validation robustness, and delivers bilingual actionable insights — all through a modern SaaS dashboard.

---

## Overview

Most API bugs in production aren't logic errors — they're validation failures. An endpoint that accepts a missing payload, swallows integers where strings are expected, or ignores incomplete data is a ticking clock.

API Sentinel runs a parallel battery of edge-case tests against any endpoint, analyzes how it handles bad input — including response body content — and produces a 0–100 quality score with severity classification and LLM-generated insights in Spanish and English.

Built for developers who want fast, automated signal about API health without writing custom test suites from scratch.

---

## Key Features

- **Real AI insights** — local LLM (`qwen3:8b` via Ollama) analyzes test results and generates bilingual, actionable insights specific to each endpoint; falls back to rule-based insights if Ollama is unavailable
- **Parallel test execution** — all test cases run concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`, reducing total test time by up to 4×
- **Smart test generation** — GET endpoints without payload run only meaningful tests; POST endpoints run the full validation suite (valid, missing, invalid types, incomplete)
- **Response body analysis** — captures the first 500 chars of each response and detects false positives (HTTP 200 with error content in body)
- **Response time scoring** — slow responses (>1.5s warn, >3s critical) reduce the quality score and trigger dedicated insights
- **0–100 quality score** — multi-factor scoring: validation gaps, false positives, and response time penalties
- **Severity classification** — Low / High / Critical rating surfaced instantly
- **Live dashboard** — dark-mode SaaS UI with KPI cards, score bars, severity badges, body preview column, and toast notifications
- **Bearer token shortcut** — dedicated auth token field auto-injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header across all test cases
- **Test history with pagination** — SQLite-backed persistence with page navigation (20 per page); click any row to reload the full result
- **JSON export** — download any result as a structured report

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Uvicorn |
| AI Engine | Ollama (`qwen3:8b`) via REST API |
| HTTP Testing | `requests` library, `ThreadPoolExecutor` (parallel) |
| Analysis Engine | Rule-based issue detection + LLM insight generation |
| Persistence | SQLite via `sqlite3` (Repository pattern) |
| Frontend | HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3 (dark mode design system) |

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally with `qwen3:8b` pulled

```bash
# Pull the model (one-time setup)
ollama pull qwen3:8b
```

> **Note:** Ollama is optional. If unavailable, the system falls back to bilingual rule-based insights automatically — no configuration needed.

## How It Works

```
1. User submits URL + method + optional payload
        ↓
2. Test generator creates 1–4 edge-case variants
   (GET without payload → 1-2 tests; POST → up to 4)
        ↓
3. ThreadPoolExecutor runs all tests in parallel
   Each result captures: status code, response time, body (500 chars)
        ↓
4. Analysis engine detects issues:
   · Missing payload accepted (−30 pts)
   · Invalid types accepted (−40 pts)
   · False positive: 200 with error in body (−15 pts)
   · Slow response time: >1.5s (−10 pts), >3s (−20 pts)
        ↓
5. Ollama qwen3:8b generates bilingual insights
   (falls back to rule-based if Ollama unavailable)
        ↓
6. Result saved to SQLite + returned to dashboard
```

## API Usage

### `POST /run-test`

**Request**

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.example.com/users",
  "method": "POST",
  "payload": { "name": "Ivan", "age": 30 },
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer your-token" }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | Yes | Target endpoint URL |
| `method` | string | Yes | `GET` or `POST` |
| `payload` | object | No | Base JSON body for POST requests |
| `headers` | object | No | Auth or custom headers passed to all test cases |

**Response**

```json
{
  "total_tests": 4,
  "results": [
    {
      "test_name": "valid_request",
      "status_code": 201,
      "response_time": 0.142,
      "response_body": "{\"id\": 101, \"name\": \"Ivan\"}",
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "issues_detected": [
    "La API acepta solicitudes sin payload — falta validación · API accepts requests without payload — required field validation is missing"
  ],
  "severity": "high",
  "quality_score": 70,
  "ai_insights": [
    "[ES] Implementar validación de campos requeridos en el middleware · [EN] Add required field validation at the middleware layer"
  ]
}
```

## Interpreting Results

### Quality Score

| Score | Rating | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 80–100 | Excellent | Strong validation — no significant gaps detected |
| 70–79 | Good | Minor issues, low production risk |
| 40–69 | Fair | Validation gaps detected — review before deploy |
| 0–39 | Critical | Multiple failures — significant production risk |

**Scoring penalties:**

| Issue | Penalty |
|---|---|
| API accepts missing payload | −30 pts |
| API accepts invalid data types | −40 pts |
| False positive (200 + error in body) | −15 pts |
| Response time >1.5s average | −10 pts |
| Response time >3.0s average | −20 pts |

### Severity Levels

| Level | Color | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|
| Low | Green | No issues detected |
| High | Orange | Missing payload accepted, or slow response time |
| Critical | Red | Invalid data types accepted without error |

---

## Use Cases

- **Backend developers** — quick sanity check before shipping an endpoint
- **QA engineers** — automated first-pass validation testing without writing fixtures
- **Code reviewers** — verify that a new endpoint enforces its own contracts
- **API consumers** — assess the reliability of a third-party API you depend on

---

## Why This Matters

APIs that don't validate their inputs fail silently. A missing required field might cause a null reference downstream. An integer where a string is expected might corrupt a database record. A 200 response with an error in the body is a contract violation that slips past every status-code-only monitor.

API Sentinel makes that early detection automatic — no test suite to maintain, no fixtures to write. Paste a URL, run the test, and get LLM-generated insights in seconds.

---

## Limitations

- **GET and POST only** — PUT, PATCH, DELETE are not supported in this version
- **Static test generation** — edge cases are type-based; domain-specific business logic is not inferred
- **Auth headers are pass-through only** — no OAuth flows or token refresh; paste a bearer token manually if needed
- **SQLite** — suitable for local use and demos; migrate to PostgreSQL for production (only `database.py` needs to change, Repository pattern is already in place)
- **Ollama must be running locally** — no cloud LLM fallback; rule-based insights are used if Ollama is unreachable

---

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Additional HTTP methods (PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 / token-refresh support for protected endpoints
- [ ] History search and filtering
- [ ] Saved test configurations (name and reuse URL + payload combos)
- [ ] PDF export with branded report layout
- [ ] Custom test case editor for domain-specific edge cases
- [ ] OpenAPI spec import for automated endpoint discovery
- [ ] Load testing mode (concurrent requests, percentile latency)
